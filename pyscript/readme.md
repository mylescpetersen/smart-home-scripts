# Smart-Home Python Scripts through Pyscript & Home Assistant

[Pyscript](https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript) is a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) community add-on that allows for smart-home scripting and automation through Python, removing the need to declare automations through YAML.

All scripts/automations are located in the 'pyscript' folder, with entity information stored in each respective file under 'pyscript_modules'
